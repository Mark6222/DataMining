        "\n",
        "In this week's lecture we're going to deepen our investigation to how Python can be used to manipulate, clean, and query data by looking at the Pandas data tool kit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas was created by Wes McKinney in 2008, and is an open source project under a very permissive license. It has a strong community, with over one hundred software developers all committing code to help make it better. Pandas borrows many concepts from R and provides a consistent interface to numpy, the python core libraries, some plotting routines and a variety of python statistical tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Resources for learning pandas\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Stack Overflow is used broadly within the software development community to post questions about programming, programming languages, and programming toolkits. The Pandas community, in particular, uses it as their number one resource for helping new members. It's quite possible if you post a question to Stack Overflow, and tag it as being Pandas and Python related, that a core Pandas developer will actually respond to your question. Stack Overflow is also a great place to go to see what issues people are having and how they can be solved.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Books\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2012 Wes McKinney wrote the definitive Pandas reference book called _Python for Data Analysis_ and published by O'Reilly, and it has been updated since. Another good reference is _Learning the Pandas Library_ by Matt Harrison. If you just want to learn the basics of Pandas and want to do so quickly, it is well laid out can be had for a good price.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Blogs\n",
        "\n",
        "data science and machine learning are evolving rapidly. Marco Rodriguez and Tim Golden maintain a wonderful blog aggregator site called Planet Python. You can visit the webpage at planetpython.org. There's lots of regular Python data science contributors.\n",

        "\n",

        "Of course this is just a fraction of the resources available! Indeed, these notebooks draw upon upon the work of others. I may add other resources later. Please share any useful resources you find in the slack workspace associated with this module."

        "The series is one of the core data structures in pandas. It is a cross between a list and a dictionary. The items are all stored in an order and there are labels with which you can retrieve them. An easy way to visualize this is two columns of data. The first is the special index, a lot like keys in a dictionary. The second is your actual data. It's important to note that the data column has a label of its own and can be retrieved using the `.name` attribute. A dictionary does not have this attribute, but it is useful later when merging multiple columns of data.\n",
