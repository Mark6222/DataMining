        "Regular expressions are used to describe patterns in text (strings). Typically regexes are used to find matches, to split strings, to create new strings according to a pattern, etc. Text data plays a big role in machine learning. Sometimes the built-in string handling features are just not enough - regular expressions greatly extend what \"regular\" python can do with strings.\n",
